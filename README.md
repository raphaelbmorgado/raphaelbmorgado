Hello, everyone!
My name is Raphael Morgado, I'm a civil engineer from Brazil and I passionate about solving problems.
I was always drawn into figuring out better ways of doing things. And this is what motivated me learning programming.
I am currently adding some programming skills and BI tools to my working routine, trying to optimize every possible activity.
I have knowledge on Python language, using libraries such as Pandas and Numpy, and also some Machine Learning algorithms.

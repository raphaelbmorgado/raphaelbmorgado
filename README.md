Hello, everyone!

My name is Raphael Morgado, I'm graduated in civil engineer and I passionate about solving problems. I was always drawn into figuring out better ways of doing things. And this is what motivated me learning programming. At the end of 2024 I started a MBA in Data Science & Analytics.

In 2023, I started a career change, migrating from Project Management to become a Data Analyst. The path has not been easy but it is certainly very fascinating. I already learned much about SQL queries and DAX language, but also a few about data engineering.

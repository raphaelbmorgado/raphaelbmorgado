Hello, everyone!

My name is Raphael Morgado, I'm graduated in civil engineer and I am passionate about solving problems. I was always drawn into figuring out better ways of doing things. And this is what motivated me learning programming. At the end of 2024 I started a MBA in Data Science & Analytics.

I have been working with data for a few years, even before becoming a Data Analyst. As a graduated Civil Engineering, I used to work with data since I was a student. The path to changing career was smooth as possible, since I already had some skills on data analysis.

MAIN KNOWLEDGES:
- Python language (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn...);
- SQL (Commom Table Expressions, procedures...);
- DataViz (Power BI and DAX language);
- Descriptive and inferential statistics.
